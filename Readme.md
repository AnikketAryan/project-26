Tips
Expert Tips
Tomatoes: Since tomatoes are the key ingredient, make sure to use ripe, red and firm tomatoes with a slightly sweet taste. The tomatoes should not be very sour or tangy.
Paneer (cottage cheese): Always use homemade paneer if possible or a good quality store brought fresh paneer. It is best to make paneer at home and does not take much time.
Tomato puree: Do make a really smooth puree from the tomatoes. If you want you can strain the tomato puree also.
Cooking tomato puree: The tomato puree has to be sautéed and cooked really well. Oil or butter should leave sides of the sautéed tomato puree. If the tomato puree is not sautéed well, the raw flavor of tomatoes will be felt in the dish.
Butter: Use good quality butter. You can use both unsalted or salted butter. Both yellow butter or white butter can be added.
Cashew paste: To blend cashews to a fine consistency, it is better to soak them in hot water for 30 minutes.
Replacement for cashews: If you don’t have cashews then the best alternative is almonds. Soak the almonds in hot water for 30 minutes. Then peel them and blend to a fine consistency with little water.
Taste and flavor: If the gravy tastes tangy or sour, then to balance the sour taste you can add a bit of sugar or cream. But do not add too much sugar as then the gravy becomes too sweet. Also, do note if you add cream then you might have to add less sugar in the gravy.
Frying paneer: You can fry the paneer cubes if you want and then add in the prepared gravy or sauce.
Color: To get the bright orangish-red color, it is best to use Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch instead of artificial food colors. Using deep red colored tomatoes also contribute to a lovely orange color in the gravy.

You can add milk powder, but you have to be careful as it makes the dish excessively sweet. I would suggest to add ½ tablespoon initially and do a taste check.
